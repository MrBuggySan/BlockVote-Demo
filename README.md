**BlockVote Demo**
=============
This is the work done to create a website and Node.js server for a simple voting app that uses [Hyperledfer Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric). This is the demo of the real application, [BlockVote](https://github.com/MrBuggySan/VotingClient-BlockVote) which uses Android apps as the front end instead of a website. 

The Blockchain implementation is hosted on [Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/). Since Bluemix charges money everytime the website is used **I had to turn off the voting website**. If you are interested in seeing the demo you can message me!
